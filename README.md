# Bouncing-Balls-Pygame
A simulation of balls bouncing across a screen using custom physics, made in Pygame.

## Description
This project is a simulation of bouncing balls (5 by default, # when ran in command line as ./bounce.py #) in a small window that pops up. Custom physics were created to replicate how spheres would bounce off each other at the many possible angles they may bounce. Once each ball bounces a certain amount of times, they'll explode and stop their movement.

Keys that can be pressed to change aspects of the simulation:

a: unique numbers appear on every ball

p: the balls' movements are paused

e: explosions are turned on/off

s: sound effects are turned on/off

x: scene is exited

t: music is turned on/off
